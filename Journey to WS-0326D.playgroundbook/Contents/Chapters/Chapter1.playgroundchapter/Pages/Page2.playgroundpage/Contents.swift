Please scan a vertical wall and place the portal ðŸšª on it. You may enter the outer space through it.

* Experiment:
Find a stable vertical wall and scan it slowly until the deploy area is stable. Then press `Deploy` button to open the portal.

- Important:
It is strongly recommended to run the game in a **Full Screen** + **Landscape** mode.

- Note:
If your game crashed, you can transfer it again from AirDrop or rerun it.
