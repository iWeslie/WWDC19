*Yes, I remember Adlestrop -*\
*The name, because one afternoon*\
*Of heat the express-train drew up there*\

 When you look up at the starry sky, have you ever wondered where the stars in the sky are coming from, and what is their ultimate fate?
 
 The Sun ☀️, like many other stars in the universe, also has its birth and death. But, the stars, not like people, have a very long life. Compared to the sun, we are just passengers in the universe.
 
 - Note:
 The sun was born **4.6 billion** years ago, and it will expand outward in the distant future and eventually die.
 
 Suppose we can travel through time, we may see the whole life of our sun.
